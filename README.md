# stocksManagement
This is a system for stocks management.

Struts2, Spring, Mybatis, MySql(View,Trigger),Proxool are the main sources to use apart from html,css,javascript and ajax.

To better realise need to process items information, I created three **VIEW**S in MySql Database for item info and two **TRIGGER**S for journal account of in and out.

In the project, my skill to design a database has been trained. Mybatis is developer-friendly I think.

Nevertheness, the performance remains a question. I firstly did not use view. It took me quite some time to figure out how to transfer the java logic into mysql view creation. Thank god! I finally made it.

There is still much to learn.
